						<p class=" ">Once upon a time, in a far away planet called Flamma, lived a remarkable species known as Flammars. They achieved such victorious technological and diplomatical achivements in just a couple generations. However, with all their achievements, they began to feel disconnected from their sense of morality and responsibility. They felt as if they were losing touch with their own humanity.</p>
						<p class=" ">To combat this feeling of detachment, the Flammars came up with a believe system to divide themselves into three spiritual wings that will affect not only their soul but their flames too. After all their flames are just a mere projection of their souls to the outside world.</p>
						<p class=" ">The Crimson Wing, represents those who value rationality, logic, and objectivity above all else. Members of this wing tend to prioritize facts and empirical evidence over emotions and intuition when making decisions. They value clarity, precision, and accuracy, and tend to approach problems in a systematic, analytical way. Crimson Wing members tend to be methodical, organized, and detail-oriented, and are often drawn to fields such as science, mathematics, engineering, and finance. They are often seen as the "thinkers" of society, and are respected for their intelligence and expertise.</p>
						<p class=" ">The Violet Wing, represents those who value passion, creativity, and self-expression above all else. Members of this wing tend to prioritize their emotions and intuition over logic and reason when making decisions. They value authenticity, spontaneity, and originality, and tend to approach problems in a holistic, intuitive way. Violet Wing members tend to be artistic, imaginative, and sensitive, and are often drawn to fields such as the arts, music, literature, and design. They are often seen as the "dreamers" of society, and are admired for their ability to inspire and move others.</p>
						<p class=" ">The Cyan Wing, represents those who value empathy, compassion, and human connection above all else. Members of this wing tend to prioritize relationships and community over individual achievement. They value harmony, cooperation, and understanding, and tend to approach problems in a collaborative, empathetic way. Cyan Wing members tend to be social, caring, and altruistic, and are often drawn to fields such as education, healthcare, social work, and activism. They are often seen as the "helpers" of society, and are revered for their dedication to improving the lives of others.</p>
						<p class=" ">Despite their differences, the Flammars' wings were accepted by their society. They each had unique beliefs and values that allowed them to connect with their humanity in a way that they had never felt before. Their story serves as a reminder that even the most powerful beings can lose sight of what truly matters, but it's never too late to find their way back.</p>
